# Data

Tend is local-first. By default, user data lives under:

```text
~/.attention/
  attention.db
  data/
  logs/
  exports/
```

Override the runtime root with:

```sh
ATTENTION_HOME=/path/to/attention tend start
```

## Current Storage

- `attention.db` stores local runtime metadata, active workspace feed membership, editable prompt/policy documents, feed cards, routine action groups, source recipes/checkpoints, source run records, sweep state/artifacts, revision records, feed audit events, and queued/claimed/completed work items.
- `data/workspace.json` mirrors active feed membership for backup compatibility and migration from older local installs.
- `data/global-policy.md`, `data/prompts/*.md`, `data/feeds/*/policy.md`, and `data/feeds/*/prompts/*.md` mirror editable prompt/policy documents for backup compatibility and readable local debugging.
- `data/feeds/*/cards/*.json` mirrors feed cards for backup compatibility and readable local debugging.
- `data/feeds/*/routine-actions/*.json` mirrors routine action groups for backup compatibility and readable local debugging.
- `data/feeds/*/sources.json`, `data/feeds/*/sources/*.md`, and `data/feeds/*/checkpoints/*.json` mirror source recipes and checkpoints.
- `data/feeds/*/runs/*.json` mirrors source run records for backup compatibility and readable local debugging.
- `data/feeds/*/sweep-state.json`, `data/feeds/*/sweeps/*.json`, and `data/feeds/*/sweep-feedback/*.json` mirror sweep state, batches, and feedback traces.
- `data/revision-proposals/*.json`, `data/workspace-revisions/*.json`, and `data/feeds/*/policy-revisions/*.json` mirror revision records.
- `data/feeds/*/events.jsonl` mirrors feed audit events for backup compatibility and readable local debugging.
- `data/feeds/*/work/*.json` mirrors work items for backup compatibility and readable local debugging.
- `data/feeds/*/feed.md` stores a readable feed description. `data/feeds/*/raw/**` stores immutable raw evidence snapshots.
- `data/mind-context/binding.json` mirrors the one bound Chronicle publisher.
- `data/mind-context/updates/*.json` mirrors recent privacy-filtered On Your Mind publications and
  retains older records while a card references them for provenance.
  Full filtered OCR exists only in these local records and the dedicated `/mind` detail API; it is
  omitted from publication receipts, normal feed CLI output, cards, and logs.

## Connector Credentials

Tend does not store Gmail, GitHub, Slack, browser, or other connector credentials. Those live in the local Codex Desktop runtime.

## Backup

```sh
tend backup export
tend backup export ./tend-backup
tend stop
tend backup import ./tend-backup
```

The export command writes a backup directory with:

```text
tend-backup/
  attention.db
  data/
  manifest.json
```

`attention.db` is a consistent SQLite snapshot of the runtime authority. `data/` contains readable
file mirrors and immutable raw evidence snapshots. Export writes through a temporary staging
directory and refuses to overwrite or delete an existing destination.

Import first copies the backup into a temporary staging directory. Tend refuses to import while
the same runtime home is active, then swaps the staged database and data into place with rollback if
the swap fails. Older data-directory-only backups are still accepted; the next local runtime start
rehydrates `attention.db` from those imported file mirrors.
